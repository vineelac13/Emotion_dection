**Facial Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System**

EmoMusic is an intelligent, real-time music recommendation system that uses facial emotion recognition to suggest personalized songs based on your mood. It captures your facial expressions through a webcam, analyzes your emotions using deep learning, and recommends appropriate music directly from YouTube.

## 🔍 Features

* 🎥 Real-time facial emotion detection via webcam
* 😄 Emotion classification: Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral
* 🎶 Music recommendation tailored to detected emotions
* 📺 YouTube integration for song playback
* 📊 High-accuracy emotion detection using CNN & Dlib
* 🌐 Built using Python, OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow, and Streamlit

## 🏗 Modules

* **Webcam Module** – Captures live facial expressions
* **Emotion Detection Module** – Classifies emotions using trained ML models
* **Music Recommendation Module** – Maps emotion to suitable songs
* **YouTube Integration** – Streams recommended music via YouTube API

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python, OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow/Keras
* Streamlit (for web UI)
* YouTube Data API
* Custom & FER2013 datasets

## 💡 How It Works

1. User opens the app, webcam captures face
2. Facial landmarks are extracted and passed to the ML model
3. Emotion is predicted (happy/sad/angry/neutral)
4. Music recommendation is generated and fetched from YouTube
5. Music is played directly within the app

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* 🎵 Offline mode using local music libraries
* 🌍 Multilingual music support
* 🎯 Improved emotion classification using hybrid deep models
* 🙋 User customization for emotion-music mapping
